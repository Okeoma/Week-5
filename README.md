# Week-4
## Week 5: Deployment of Flask App to AWS Cloud

This project involves the deployment of a web app to AWS cloud using the Python and Flask 
framework. I used a dummy dataset (insurance.csv) along with a trained model 
(RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble) saved as model.pkl, which is to be used to 
predict Premium Health Insurance charges.
The necessary files and directories, including the Flask app (app.py), HTML templates, CSS file, was 
placed in their respective folders.
